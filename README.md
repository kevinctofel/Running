MPHtoPacePerMile takes a speed input (as MPH) and converts it to pace per mile.

I created this because most treadmills these days do not show pace. Instead, they display speed in MPH, which most runners don't care about.

Goal is to take this Java code and put it behind a simple interface on Android so runners can input the MPH from their treadmill and quickly see the pace per mile.
